# beam-bvm-util
A rust crate that adds extra functionality that isn't the direct generated types for beam-bvm-interface

## What to expect

A light wrapper around beam_bvm_interface with some extra utilities that would be useful for interacting with the bvm.

Documentation of the methods usable within the BVM can be found at the [BeamMW Shader-SDK wiki](https://github.com/BeamMW/shader-sdk/wiki)

## Installation

Install with cargo: 

`cargo install beam_bvm_util`
